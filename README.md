I created two apps (gettings, person), the first one returns the name of an employee and his description and I integrated this app with the watchlist and popular tap using Axios to fetch the data from backend, I put the code of integration in the watchlist, and popular component.
the second app includes the information about the user and I try to update the person tap from the backend, I succeeded in fetching the first name, last name, and contentpost, integration images need a lot of time.
that's all.
